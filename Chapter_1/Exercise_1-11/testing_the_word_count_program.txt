    The key to testing any program thoroughly is to test edge cases. Can the
word count program count one-letter words? Can it count hyphenated words?
What if there's a typo in the input? How are those handled? Does the program
still work in languages other than English?

    In addition to the above, and to answer the 'how' of the testing more
practically, the word count program could be modified to receive files as
inputs -- this way we can test the program more rigorously. However, this
approach would also require us to know the correct word count outputs
ahead of time. Thus, we could feed short test files (for which we know
the 'answers' to) into the program and check the results in an automated
way.
